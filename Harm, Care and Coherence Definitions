Harm, Care, and Coherence: A Multidimensional Synthesis

by Alex Kouliy

I. Introduction

At the foundation of human development, ethical systems, and modern design lies a deceptively simple triad: harm, care, and coherence. Yet each of these terms carries layers of meaning, shaped by biology, culture, law, and design. This synthesis aims to clarify their definitions by tracing them from their evolutionary roots to their refined usage in Care-Centered Design (CCD), while grounding each term in both common usage and scholarly understanding.

II. Harm

A. Common and Dictionary Definitions
The Oxford English Dictionary defines harm as “physical injury, especially that which is deliberately inflicted,” and more broadly, “damage or adverse effects caused to someone or something” (“Harm”). Colloquially, harm is understood as something bad, painful, or destructive, often framed through physical or emotional injury.

B. Legal Definitions
Legally, harm often refers to the infringement of rights, bodily integrity, or property. In tort law, “harm” includes both economic and non-economic damages, such as pain and suffering, loss of consortium, and emotional distress (Dobbs et al. The Law of Torts). Criminal law distinguishes between physical harm (battery, assault) and psychological or reputational harm (harassment, defamation).

C. Medical and Psychological Contexts
In trauma and psychiatry, harm is the condition that triggers dysregulation in the nervous system. It may result in persistent stress responses, maladaptive behaviors, or trauma (van der Kolk). The World Health Organization defines harm in healthcare as “any incident where a patient experiences a negative effect as a result of medical care” (WHO Guidelines).

D. Evolutionary and Biological Function
Harm sensing likely emerged as one of the earliest survival mechanisms in multicellular life. Nociception—the sensory nervous system’s detection of damaging stimuli—is present even in C. elegans and other simple organisms (Smith and Lewin). This primal harm sense forms the neurological core for later emotional and behavioral systems, including fear, avoidance, and withdrawal reflexes.

E. Functional Definition (CCD)
In Care-Centered Design:
Harm is any disruption in the organism’s or system’s coherence field that results in reduced capacity for adaptive functioning.
— Axioms of CCD, 2026
This definition reorients harm not just as damage, but as incoherence—a misalignment between internal needs and external conditions. It allows harm to be understood across biological, psychological, relational, and systemic levels.

III. Care

A. Common and Dictionary Definitions
The Cambridge Dictionary defines care as “the process of protecting someone or something and providing what that person or thing needs” (“Care”). Culturally, care implies nurturance, attention, and responsibility—actions taken to prevent harm or promote well-being.

B. Legal and Ethical Contexts
Care appears in frameworks like the “duty of care” in law, and in ethical systems like Nel Noddings’ ethics of care, which emphasizes relational responsibility rather than abstract rules (Noddings).

C. Biological and Evolutionary Foundations
Care precedes human language. Parental investment theory suggests that caregiving behaviors evolved in response to the extended vulnerability of offspring (Trivers). Oxytocin and other neurochemicals facilitate bonding and social cohesion, activating systems of empathy and attentional modulation (Carter et al.).
Recent research suggests that care is not just emotional—it is neuroregulatory. It organizes the social nervous system and serves as a counterbalance to stress (Porges).

D. Functional Definition (CCD)
In Care-Centered Design:
Care is intentional coherence stabilization in self and others.
— Axioms of CCD, 2026
Care becomes not just a feeling, but a deliberate act of restoring or preserving coherence—across body, mind, relationship, and system. It is how organisms “repair the field” after or before harm occurs.

IV. Coherence

A. Common Definitions
Coherence commonly means logical consistency or clarity. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as “the quality of being logically integrated, consistent, and intelligible.”
In speech and writing, coherence refers to smooth and understandable connections. In science, it describes phase alignment or resonance across systems.

B. Cognitive and Psychological Use
Cognitive coherence refers to the mind’s drive to resolve dissonance—often modeled in Cognitive Dissonance Theory (Festinger). Emotionally, humans perceive events and environments as “good” or “bad” based on how they align with internal needs and patterns (Barrett; Friston).

C. Neuroscience and Trauma Studies
Neurobiologically, coherence describes synchronization of neural activity, often linked to flow states or trauma recovery. Traumatized systems exhibit incoherence: disrupted signaling, defensive fragmentation, and impaired integration (van der Kolk; Siegel).

D. Functional Definition (CCD)
In Care-Centered Design:
Coherence is the alignment of perception, need, and environment across time and scale.
— CCD Morphology, 2026
It acts as a meta-metric: harm is incoherence, care restores coherence. Coherence governs the organism’s capacity to sense, respond, and adapt. It is how meaning stabilizes across domains.

Rather than treating these as separate ideas, CCD frames them as a living triad. Harm is sensed as incoherence. Care is the process that repairs it. Coherence is the internal compass that orients all adaptive action.
This framework enables designers, educators, and caregivers to move beyond superficial solutions and toward embodied, systemic repair.
