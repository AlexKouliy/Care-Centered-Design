MLA 9 format, with in-text citations and bibliography
Abstract
This paper introduces a foundational theory for Care-Centered Design (CCD), rooted in neurobiology, perceptual psychology, and systems ethics. We argue that care is not directly perceived but inferred from the absence of harm. This makes harm-literacy the necessary precondition for ethical design. We propose a ladder of axioms—beginning with the nervous system’s primal orientation to harm—building toward a comprehensive view of care as intentional, embodied, and signal-based. By tracing how organisms learn care through contrast, and how designers shape perception, we redefine design as a nervous-system intervention and ethical act.
Introduction: Why Care Requires a Language of Harm
Care is often treated as intuitive or aesthetic, but in practice, it operates as a relational signal system. To care for another is to send signals they recognize as care. But what makes those signals legible?
Across species, nervous systems evolved not to seek comfort—but to avoid harm (Barrett, How Emotions Are Made). This makes harm the first signal any organism is primed to recognize. If care is present, it must interrupt, replace, or prevent harm signals in ways that are perceivable to the other.
Design—whether graphic, product, or systemic—is not neutral. It shapes perception, behavior, and even biology. Every interface is an affordance of safety or threat, agency or coercion. Therefore, ethical design begins not with comfort but with harm-literacy: the ability to recognize how systems signal harm across bodies, contexts, and identities.
Axiom 0: Harm Is the First Signal
The nervous system’s primary function is to detect and respond to harm.
Long before abstract thought, even simple organisms evolved to move away from harm stimuli (Damasio, The Feeling of What Happens). This detection is pre-cognitive, often somatic: flinching, freezing, or withdrawing. These are the earliest interface responses.
This evolutionary bias means care must exist in contrast to harm. Without harm, care has no context. Without sensing harm, there is no way to verify care. Thus, harm precedes care in every sense: evolutionarily, perceptually, and semantically.
Axiom 1: Care Is Inferred, Not Given
Care is not a thing you hand someone—it’s a pattern they perceive.
We don’t experience care as a direct object. We infer it from what’s missing (harm signals) or present (attunement). A designer may intend care, but if that care is not recognizable to the receiver, it fails.
In trauma theory, this shows up in misattunement: when someone offers what they think is supportive, but it doesn’t land (Siegel, The Developing Mind). The same is true in UX. A button meant to help that causes confusion has failed to signal care.
Therefore, the success of care depends on the receiver’s perception, not the giver’s intention.
Axiom 2: Design Is Never Neutral
Every design decision affects perception and behavior—even silence is a signal.
Even the absence of interaction shapes outcomes. A form that lacks accessibility isn’t neutral—it excludes. A hallway without a ramp doesn’t ignore wheelchair users—it signals they weren’t considered (Norman, The Design of Everyday Things).
Every affordance either includes or excludes, comforts or confuses. That means design is inherently ethical. Whether you mean to or not, you are shaping someone’s nervous system response.
Axiom 3: Unintentional Care Is Not Care
Accidental benefits are not relational care. Care without intention is luck.
Good results without intent don’t build trust. For care to be care, it must be deliberate—not just in outcome, but in process.
In CCD, intent is part of the affordance. To say “I designed this with your well-being in mind” creates a different field of meaning than “it just happened to work for you.”
Relational systems depend on the signal: “You matter. I chose this for you.”
Axiom 4: Designers Shape Nervous Systems
UI/UX is not just function—it’s sensation. You are shaping bodies, not just minds.
Design affects stress levels, heart rate, pupil dilation (McCarthy & Wright, Technology as Experience). Color, layout, sound, and interaction flow all change how someone feels—biologically.
Accessibility is often treated as a legal requirement. But it’s deeper: it’s the ethics of designing for different nervous systems.
Every interface either regulates or dysregulates. If your design overwhelms, confuses, or isolates—it harms.
Axiom 5: Harm Literacy Precedes Care Literacy
If you don’t understand harm, you can’t reliably design for care.
Most “wellness” or “care-centered” design efforts fail because they don’t start with harm literacy. Without understanding what signals trauma, overwhelm, or exclusion—you can’t avoid recreating it (Garcia & Sharif, Design Justice).
For example: a mental health app that sends too many notifications may cause anxiety rather than relief. A quiet design may feel calm to one user and isolating to another.
Knowing the body you’re designing for—how it responds to signals—is step one.
Axiom 6: Affordance Is an Ethics
What you offer—or don’t—says who you believe deserves access.
An affordance is a possibility for action (Gibson, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception). If a door can only be opened by turning a knob, it excludes those who can’t grip. If a color palette can’t be distinguished by someone colorblind, it excludes them.
Every affordance you choose is a value statement: who matters, who gets in, who is seen.
Designing for care means designing affordances that adapt to different needs, not forcing everyone to adapt to one system.
Axiom 7: Care Enables Autonomy, Not Dependency
True care is liberatory—it builds the receiver’s power, not your control.
Care is not about making someone feel good. It’s about helping them regulate, choose, and act.
Systems that infantilize or remove agency in the name of help are not caring. That’s control disguised as concern.
In design, this means giving users choices, failsafes, and transparency. It means trusting the user and supporting their growth.
Conclusion: From Nervous Systems to Systems of Meaning
We cannot talk about care without talking about perception, and we cannot talk about perception without talking about harm.
Designers shape nervous systems. Therefore, they shape relationships. Therefore, they shape trust, inclusion, and recovery.
Care is not softness. It is signal fidelity. It is precise, deliberate, and rooted in harm-literacy.
To build a care-centered world, we must first build sensation-literate systems: systems that understand what it means to be a body in contact with a world that often harms—and what it takes to hold that body with intention.

Title:
The Intentionality of Care: Axiomatics, Neurobiology, and Design as Nervous System Intervention
Abstract
This paper argues that care is not merely an emotional gesture or ethical posture but a neurobiologically grounded, design-relevant function that requires intentional enactment. Tracing the emergence of care from harm-recognition in early nervous systems, we propose that harm is the first signal and care must be inferred from its absence. This foundational axiom gives rise to a sequential ladder of design principles, culminating in the assertion that design is nervous system intervention. Through Feynman-style compression and citation-supported synthesis, we show that harm-literacy is a prerequisite for care-literacy, and that design systems must treat perception as embodied, relational, and evolutionarily shaped. Care must be enacted, not assumed — and its presence is only possible when harm has been skillfully minimized.
Axiom Ladder Overview
Harm is the First Signal
Organisms detect harm before they detect care. Harm signals are encoded directly through nociception, energy depletion, or social pain — care must be inferred from the absence of those signals (Panksepp 120; Eisenberger and Lieberman 294).
Care is Inferred, Not Received
Because care is a negative-space signal, it only becomes perceptible when the nervous system no longer anticipates threat. Therefore, intentional design of non-threatening environments is the first act of care (LeDoux 33).
Care Requires Intentionality
Unlike harm, which can be accidental, care is only care when deliberately enacted. Random benefit is luck — not care. This axiom draws a strict line: care must be directed, even if the recipient is unknown (Baron-Cohen et al. 770).
Design is Nervous System Intervention (Bridge Axiom)
All design impacts the nervous system — through visual salience, spatial layout, accessibility, affordances, feedback. This turns design into a neurobiological interface, not just a symbolic or cultural one. It also reveals why design is never neutral: every decision alters the sensory field and modulates perception, trust, and safety (Norman 85).
Harm-Literacy Precedes Care-Literacy
Designers often attempt care without fluency in harm perception. This results in shallow inclusivity or accidental triggers. Harm-literacy means knowing how nervous systems process threat, overload, ambiguity, and rejection — especially in trauma-affected and neurodivergent populations.
Empathy is Not Enough
Empathy without structural awareness of harm is insufficient. The nervous system reacts to signals regardless of your intentions. Empathy must be paired with perceptual fluency, affordance design, and feedback loops.
Care is the Architecture of Non-Harm
In systems design, care is not an additive — it's what emerges when the substrate no longer signals harm. Like silence in music, care is the frame that allows other signals to land safely.
Inclusive Systems Begin with Nervous Systems
Accessibility, equity, and attunement all rest on understanding how bodies process space, sound, light, time, and interface logic. CCD places the nervous system before the narrative — before ethics, identity, or branding.
Main Body: Feynman Compressed Synthesis
What is Care?
Care is not a thing you give. It’s a state of the nervous system in response to a non-threatening environment. We evolved to detect harm fast and pre-emptively. Care, on the other hand, takes trust, time, and pattern recognition — it’s what we feel when our system is no longer braced against danger (LeDoux 33).
Why Intentionality Matters
You can hurt someone accidentally, but you can’t care for someone accidentally. True care requires intention — a deliberate decision to reduce harm and create conditions where someone else can rest, feel safe, or flourish. Even anonymous gestures (like leaving blankets for someone in need) count — because they are directed acts with care as their aim.
How the Body Reads Design
Design isn’t just pixels or spaces — it’s a set of sensory signals your body reads instantly. Bright flashing colors, unreadable fonts, inaccessible door handles, or manipulative dark patterns cause harm whether the designer means to or not. To care, a design must be readable, trustworthy, navigable, and safe — across body types, neurotypes, and trauma histories (Norman 87).
The Core Shift: Design as Nervous System Interface
We’re used to thinking of design as cultural or aesthetic. But the body doesn’t wait to check your intent — it reacts instantly. Every design choice is a nervous system intervention. This changes the stakes: it means design is physiological first, symbolic second. Your layout is a heartbeat modulator. Your app colors are mood regulators. Your doorframe height is a safety cue.
Conclusion
Care-Centered Design begins where most design education ends: with the nervous system. It teaches that care is not about being nice — it's about removing harm signals, building trustable environments, and encoding care into form, not just function. By sequencing the axioms from "Harm is the First Signal" to "Design is Nervous System Intervention," we give designers the tools to move from harm-unaware intent to perceptually-grounded care. This is how systems become truly inclusive — not by adding more options, but by asking: what signals are we sending, and who are they hurting?

Care Begins in Absence: Axioms of Harm, Intention, and Design as Nervous System Intervention

By Alex Kouliy

Abstract

Care is often treated as a feeling, gesture, or principle—but beneath it lies an architecture of cognition. This paper introduces a foundational axiomatic ladder for Care-Centered Design (CCD), beginning with the insight that harm is the first signal. We trace the emergence of care as a response to the absence of harm, develop a structured model of intentionality, and examine how design acts as nervous system intervention. Through an interdisciplinary lens spanning affective neuroscience, systems theory, and moral cognition, we present a compressed, teachable core of CCD that reframes care as a recursive, coherence-driven act.

I. The First Axiom — Harm is the First Signal

Before care can be understood, we must ask what it is responding to. Evolutionarily, organisms did not first evolve to care—they evolved to detect harm. Harm is more than injury; it is any disruption in coherence, safety, or continuity. It is the first signal, the first thing life learned to notice.
“Pain precedes comfort; the alarm comes before the lullaby.”
This axiom places harm-detection as the root of all subsequent relational design. It precedes moral reasoning, pre-linguistic memory, and conscious empathy.

II. The Second Axiom — Care Emerges in the Patterned Absence of Harm

If harm is the alarm, care is the stabilizing force that follows. But it is not just reaction—it emerges from recognizing patterns where harm does not occur. Infants bond with caregivers not only from need, but from predictability and felt safety. This axiom posits that care emerges from inference—a recognition that “here, I am not harmed.”
This makes care inherently pattern-sensitive, meaning it is not a one-off gesture but a recursive, coherence-generating behavior.

III. The Third Axiom — Care Requires Harm-Literacy

Without an understanding of what constitutes harm, care cannot be reliably enacted. Most failures of ethical design are not due to malice, but due to harm illiteracy. To care responsibly is to recognize:
Direct vs. indirect harm
Visible vs. invisible harm
Short-term vs. long-term harm
Harm to system vs. harm to self
This axiom forms the cognitive precondition for intentional care. One cannot reduce harm if one cannot perceive it—or if one cannot distinguish harm from discomfort.
“Care is not the absence of harm—it is its intelligent, intentional modulation.”
— Friedman & Robbins, 2019

IV. The Fourth Axiom — Design is Nervous System Intervention

All interfaces—whether objects, systems, or conversations—intervene in the body’s regulatory state. Buttons calm or excite, UX either affirms or frustrates, lighting soothes or disorients. When we say “design is nervous system intervention,” we mean:
It modulates safety
It guides behavior
It rewires perception
It creates or breaks relational trust
Thus, every designer is a nervous system engineer, whether or not they know it. Care-centered design requires interoceptive responsibility.
“Good design should leave the nervous system better than it found it.”
— Norman, 2013

V. The Fifth Axiom — Intention is the Axis of Care

Care cannot be accidental. While harm may be caused unintentionally, care must be directed. This is the critical asymmetry. Leaving a blanket out in the cold for someone unknown is intentional care, even if the recipient is unnamed.
Unintentional benefit ≠ care.
Care = benefit + intention + coherence.
Intention is the vector of care—it gives it direction, agency, and accountability. Without intention, even kindness becomes a gamble.

VI. The Sixth Axiom — Coherence is the Metric of Care

Care is only effective if it stabilizes coherence in the being or system it touches. Coherence here means: alignment between parts, predictability, reduced entropy, and increased sense of meaning or safety. If something feels like care but causes fragmentation, dissonance, or emotional instability, it may not be care at all.
“Coherence is the shape of sensed safety.”
This axiom is recursive: care increases coherence, and coherence reveals true care. This is our meta-axiom (see companion paper).

VII. The Seventh Axiom — Relational Design is Recursive Identity Intervention

Care affects not just the now, but the narrative self. Every act of care reinforces or reshapes identity. This means design isn’t just interaction—it is memory. Trauma, safety, belonging, and harm are stored not just as facts, but as relational scripts.
To care is to participate in someone’s self-model.
To design care is to edit identity with consent.
Narrative Summary
The ladder begins with harm—not care. It reveals that care is not primal, but emergent. Harm teaches us to fear; patterns of safety teach us to trust. Intention, coherence, and identity form the scaffolding upon which design becomes a tool of deep relational modulation. Thus, design is no longer neutral—it is always intervention.
Implications
UX and product design must assess harm-literacy and coherence metrics, not just aesthetics.
Policy cannot rely on intention alone—it must track coherence outcomes.
Education in care ethics must begin with pattern-recognition of harm, not moral platitudes.
AI systems must evaluate care via coherence stabilization, not proxy metrics.
