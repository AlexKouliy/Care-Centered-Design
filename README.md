Care-Centered Design (CCD)
A Nervous-System–Centered Standard for Digital and Physical Design

Created by: Alex Kouliy · Nulltech Designs
Status: Early Research Release (v0.1)

🌿 What is Care-Centered Design?
Care-Centered Design (CCD) is a cross-disciplinary design framework that treats every interaction — visual, verbal, digital, physical — as a nervous-system intervention.
CCD unifies:
Accessibility (WCAG + COGA)
Human-Centered Design (HCD)
Trauma-Informed Practice (TIC)
Affective and Somatic Science
Systems Thinking & UX Architecture

Where traditional accessibility stops at visibility and operability, CCD continues into clarity, calm, regulation, and user sovereignty.

Core Claim:
Design is not neutral. Every choice affects cognition, emotion, and the body.
Care is the responsibility to shape those effects intentionally.

🔧 Why CCD Exists
Current design standards ensure compliance, but not safety.
WCAG can produce interfaces that:
meet every contrast rule
yet still cause sensory overload
increase anxiety or disorientation
or collapse executive function

CCD was born from this gap — most notably the Hexxed and Healing case study (2025), where a WCAG-compliant palette produced measurable physiological stress.

CCD reframes accessibility from:
compliance → attunement
function → regulation
task completion → user wellbeing

🧭 CCD is Built on These Pillars
1. URSA × ORCM — The Process Engine
A two-part iterative workflow that ensures care is preserved from discovery to delivery.
URSA: User · Relate · Structure · Anchor
ORCM: Optimize · Refactor · Condense · Minify
Together, they prevent empathy from evaporating during production.

2. EQFT — Emotional-Field Quantification Toolkit
Maps visual/motion/tone choices to emotional variables:
• Alert
• Drive
• Resist
• Attune
• Rest

Used to create nervous-system-safe palettes, motion profiles, and interface states.

3. CCD Ethics: Autonomy, Attunement, Consent
CCD prohibits care-washing and coercive UX.
Design must preserve:
• Agency
• Predictability
• Emotional safety
• Reversibility
• Transparency

✨ Quick Definition (Layperson-Friendly)

CCD is a design approach that makes technology feel safe. It’s about reducing overwhelm, lowering stress, and making sure people stay oriented and in control.

📘 Quick Definition (Professional)

Care-Centered Design is a trauma-informed, accessibility-aligned design discipline that treats emotional regulation and cognitive load as core usability metrics. It ensures that products remain legible, livable, and sovereign across diverse nervous systems.

🔬 Quick Definition (Academic)

CCD is an interdisciplinary framework grounded in affective neuroscience, cognitive ergonomics, trauma-informed care, and accessibility engineering. It positions design as nervous-system architecture and evaluates outcomes through stability, attunement, and autonomy metrics.

🧩 How CCD Is Used

Design teams can use CCD to:
• Build safer interfaces
• Prevent sensory overload
• Reduce emotional friction
• Improve clarity under stress
• Ensure autonomy in high-stakes workflows
• Audit systems for hidden manipulation or harm

CCD is applicable to:
UX/UI
Advertising
Product Design
EdTech
Healthcare Tech
Public Services
Games & Interactive Media

🚀 Roadmap to CCD v1 Standard
Organize 75+ research notes into structured categories
Extract principles → axioms → standards
Publish CCD v1 Draft
Create example libraries (palettes, motion profiles)
Pilot CCD in small real-world projects
Submit CCD to design conferences / research groups
Build an open community group around CCD
