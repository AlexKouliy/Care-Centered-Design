Care-Centered Design (CCD)
A Nervous-System–Centered Standard for Digital and Physical Design

What is Care-Centered Design?
Care-Centered Design (CCD) is a cross-disciplinary design framework that treats every interaction — visual, verbal, digital, physical — as a nervous-system intervention.
CCD unifies:
• Accessibility (WCAG + COGA)
• Human-Centered Design (HCD)
• Trauma-Informed Practice (TIC)
• Affective and Somatic Science
• Systems Thinking & UX Architecture

Where traditional accessibility stops at visibility and operability, CCD continues into clarity, calm, regulation, and user sovereignty.

Core Claim:
Design is not neutral. Every choice affects cognition, emotion, and the body. Care is the responsibility to shape those effects intentionally.

Why CCD Exists
Current design standards ensure compliance, but not safety.
WCAG can produce interfaces that meet every contrast rule, yet still cause sensory overload, increase anxiety or disorientation, or collapse executive function.

CCD was born from this gap — most notably the Hexxed and Healing case study (Early 2025), where a WCAG-compliant palette produced measurable physiological stress.

CCD reframes accessibility from:
compliance → attunement
function → regulation
task completion → user wellbeing

CCD is Built on Three Pillars

1. URSA × ORCM — The Process Engine
A two-part iterative workflow that ensures care is preserved from discovery to delivery.
URSA: User · Relate · Structure · Anchor
ORCM: Optimize · Refactor · Condense · Minify
Together, they prevent empathy from evaporating during production.

2. EQFT — Emotional-Field Quantification Toolkit
Maps visual/motion/tone choices to emotional variables:
• Alert
• Drive
• Resist
• Attune
• Rest

Used to create nervous-system-safe palettes, motion profiles, and interface states.

3. CCD Ethics: Autonomy, Attunement, Consent
CCD prohibits care-washing and coercive UX.
Design must preserve:
• Agency
• Predictability
• Emotional safety
• Reversibility
• Transparency


Definitions

Quick Definition (Layperson-Friendly)

CCD is a design approach that makes technology feel safe. It’s about reducing overwhelm, lowering stress, and making sure people stay oriented and in control.

Quick Definition (Professional)

Care-Centered Design is a trauma-informed, accessibility-aligned design discipline that treats emotional regulation and cognitive load as core usability metrics. It ensures that products remain legible, livable, and sovereign across diverse nervous systems.

Quick Definition (Academic)

CCD is an interdisciplinary framework grounded in affective neuroscience, cognitive ergonomics, trauma-informed care, and accessibility engineering. It positions design as nervous-system architecture and evaluates outcomes through stability, attunement, and autonomy metrics.

How CCD Is Used

Design teams can use CCD to:
• Build safer interfaces
• Prevent sensory overload
• Reduce emotional friction
• Improve clarity under stress
• Ensure autonomy in high-stakes workflows
• Audit systems for hidden manipulation or harm

CCD is applicable to:
• UX/UI
• Advertising
• Product Design
• EdTech
• Healthcare Tech
• Public Services
• Games & Interactive Media

Roadmap to CCD v1 Standard
Organize 75+ research notes into structured categories
Extract principles → axioms → standards
Publish CCD v1 Draft
Create example libraries (palettes, motion profiles)
Pilot CCD in small real-world projects
Submit CCD to design conferences / research groups
Build an open community group around CCD
