From Pain to Purpose:
A Journey Through the Evolution of Harm, Care, and Design

By Alex Kouliy

Introduction

Before we built cities, tools, or language, we evolved to feel. The pain of an open wound, the tension of threat, the calm of a safe presence—these were not abstractions. They were the primal languages of survival. But within those signals lay something more: the seeds of care.
This essay traces the arc from those evolutionary roots to the design decisions shaping modern human systems. It argues that care is not a social construct layered atop cognition, but a biologically emergent principle rooted in harm perception—long predating human intellect. From that foundation, we explore how design became a nervous system intervention, how trauma disrupts our interface with the world, and why intentional, coherent systems are not optional—they are a biological imperative.

I. Harm Is the First Signal

Long before cognition, organisms developed mechanisms for detecting harm—a survival imperative encoded in their structure. Nociception, the neural process that detects injury or threat, exists in simple invertebrates such as sea slugs and leeches (Walters and Williams, 2019). Even single-celled organisms like Paramecium exhibit avoidant behavior in response to chemical gradients—clear evidence that harm sensing precedes awareness (Allen, 2009).
As nervous systems evolved, they prioritized threat detection. According to Kavaliers (1988), nociception is one of the most evolutionarily conserved features across species. As Barrett (2017) notes, the human brain functions as a prediction engine, optimizing survival by anticipating disruption. Pain and threat were the first priority, not as emotional events, but as pattern breaks in bodily regulation.

II. Care Emerges Through Inference

While harm signals trigger reflexes, care must be inferred. It is recognized when expected rupture doesn’t occur—when pattern holds. The nervous system builds safety from this continuity.
Care emerges as the body registers non-threat across time. It is inferred through absence of rupture and presence of coherence—predictable feedback, synchronized rhythms, and mutual regulation (Porges, 2011). This is clearest in mammals: grooming, vocal soothing, and proximity-seeking behaviors co-evolved with distress regulation (Clutton-Brock, 2021; Bekoff, 2001).
Importantly, not all organisms require care to survive. Many thrive without it. But in species with extended dependency, like humans, care becomes critical infrastructure—a distributed regulation system externalized through sociality, tools, and environment.

III. From Signal to Interface: Proto-Design in Evolution

Design predates humans. Camouflage, mimicry, warning coloration, and spatial structuring (like burrows or nests) are not symbolic—they’re modulations of signal environments (Lehmann et al., 2013).
As “fixed action patterns” (FAPs) evolved—hardwired behaviors triggered by environmental cues—these organisms became participants in interface logic (Wikipedia, “Fixed Action Pattern”). When prey freeze at a shadow, or ants follow pheromone trails, we see evolved relationships between perception and response—a primitive form of design through signal.
This matters for Care-Centered Design (CCD) because it reveals that interfaces are older than intention. The modulation of experience—what CCD defines as design—emerged through evolution long before symbols or conscious tools.

IV. Sociality and the Roots of Care Inference

With social complexity came the pressure to interpret others’ signals. Early caregiving behaviors like alloparenting, helpers at the nest, and cooperative breeding show that organisms evolved to respond to others’ needs, not just their own (West et al., 2007; Wikipedia, “Alloparenting”).
These social mechanisms required emotional coordination—what Bekoff (2001) calls the roots of social morality in animals. From play behaviors to distress mimicry, affiliative signals began to serve regulatory functions.
Empathy-like systems emerged when observing another’s pain activated shared circuits in the observer. Mirror neurons and the anterior cingulate cortex are implicated in both experienced and observed distress (Wikipedia, “Mirror neuron”).
Decety (2011) frames this as neuroevolutionary empathy: brains capable of sharing internal states enabled care inference to emerge as a survival tool.

V. Human Emotion and Plasticity

What makes human emotion unique is not that we feel more—but that we construct emotional meaning through context. According to the theory of constructed emotion (Barrett, 2017; Jungilligens et al., 2022), emotional states are not hardwired responses but predictions based on internal models and interoceptive cues.
Humans are able to simulate, anticipate, and modulate care—and to design environments that regulate others. Singer (2025) emphasizes that the human emotional brain is plastic, meaning empathy, attunement, and co-regulation can be trained or suppressed depending on environmental input.
This is critical for CCD: our emotional systems are not fixed—they are designed through experience.

VI. Trauma as Dysregulated Interface

If care is continuity, trauma is fracture.
Trauma does not begin with violence—it begins when threat overwhelms regulation and is encoded as baseline. As van der Kolk (2014) explains, trauma reshapes how the brain predicts safety, making neutrality feel dangerous and stress feel familiar. Peckham (2023) further connects this to neuroplastic adaptation: the brain encodes harm patterns if they are repeated enough.
In this context, design becomes high-stakes. A triggering interface is not bad design—it is a biological rupture. As Wyatt (2025) describes, even digital platforms can create chronic stress when patterns are unpredictable or manipulative. Design becomes a site of harm—or healing.

VII. Empathy, Access, and the Limits of Conventional Design

Human-Centered Design (HCD) reframed usability through the lens of the “average user.” But the nervous system has no average. Comfort for one may be overload for another.
Accessible design, as guided by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (W3C, 1999), moved the field toward equity—but often stopped at what the body can do, not what the body feels.
Care-Centered Design (CCD) reframes this: every interface is a nervous system intervention. Trauma-informed design frameworks already show how regulation can be supported through light, layout, sound, and affordance (TiD Society, 2025).
But CCD goes further: it holds that “Harm is the first signal”, and that care must be designed through intentional coherence across systems of meaning.

VIII. Coherence, Resonance, and the Biological Metric of Care

To determine whether care is present, we ask: Does this feel safe to the body?
Coherence is not branding alignment—it is the alignment between perception, physiology, and expectation. When sensory inputs, environmental cues, and outcomes align, the nervous system can relax prediction—and trust returns.
This is not theoretical. As Seamon (2013) notes, place coherence affects emotional stability. Porges (2011) defines safety not as a state of mind but a state of the autonomic nervous system—built through rhythm, pattern, and relational tone.
Resonance is the felt result of coherence. A system that supports regulation feels right. A system that contradicts itself—even subtly—fractures trust.

IX. From Evolution to Intention: A New Arc of Design

We began with single cells sensing gradients of harm. We arrive at humans designing interfaces that regulate others’ nervous systems.
Across this evolutionary arc, care is not sentiment—it is structural alignment with survival. Harm gives us urgency. Pattern gives us safety. Coherence gives us meaning.
To design with care is not to soften. It is to listen across time, to build with attunement, and to craft environments that remember what it means to be alive in a body shaped by harm.
Design, then, becomes not just a craft—but a biological ethic.
