Abstract

This paper traces how harm and care have manifested, evolved, and structured human life from prehistory to the present. Drawing from anthropology, evolutionary biology, public health, moral philosophy, and design history, we map five epochs of human responses to harm: prehistoric social care; ancient moral and civic systems; medieval and early-modern institutions; the public-health revolution; and modern participatory design. These epochs demonstrate that harm and care are not static concepts but dynamic responses shaped by biology, culture, and technology — culminating in contemporary frameworks such as trauma-informed practice and human-centered design. This historical arc positions Care-Centered Design (CCD) not as a novelty but as the latest expression of a long human lineage attempting to understand, prevent, and transform harm.

Epoch I — Prehistoric Care: The First Human Answer to Harm
Long before cities, laws, or hospitals, care existed as an evolutionary strategy. Early hominins were already tending to injured group members — behavior made possible by cooperative breeding, long childhoods, and shared vulnerability.
Archaeological evidence shows that Neanderthals and early Homo species cared for injured individuals for extended periods. A 2024 report on a Neanderthal child’s infected femur indicates years of sustained care, despite no direct utility to the caregivers (“Bone of Neanderthal Child”). This aligns with evolutionary research demonstrating that caregiving behaviors evolved from mammalian offspring systems and later expanded to group-level support (Kessler, “Why Care”).
These early behaviors emerged because social structure enabled them. Cooperative caregiving systems — such as alloparenting and “helpers at the nest” found in many mammals and birds — provided the scaffolding for complex human care networks (Kessler et al.). As humans evolved richer emotional repertoires and longer developmental periods, psychological care also became adaptive. Studies on the evolution of consoling touch show these behaviors in primates as early forms of emotional repair (“Consoling Touch”).
By the time symbolic culture emerged, care was already a biological language — a tuned response to vulnerability, injury, and emotional distress.
Care begins as survival. It becomes culture through time.

Epoch II — Ancient Civilizations: Moral Orders and Civic Responsibility
With the formation of early states, harm and care became moral and political categories. Ancient philosophical traditions articulated duties toward others, while early legal systems codified who deserved protection — and who did not.
Greek ethics framed care as moral concern. Aristotle’s notions of friendship and benevolence shaped early ideas of mutual responsibility (Osuntade). Meanwhile, religious traditions across the ancient world—from Confucian filial piety to Buddhist compassion—framed care as a civic good, binding communities.
These ideas were not merely philosophical. They shaped real institutions:
• Egyptian and Greek physicians formalized care practices.
• Roman sanitation and aqueducts became early public-health engineering (Tulchinsky).
• Early welfare measures, such as grain distribution in Rome, addressed collective harm.
Simultaneously, harm was conceptualized legally — property damage, bodily injury, and civic disorder. Most ancient legal codes attempted to systematize harm, assigning penalties and obligations that reflect early structural attempts to manage human vulnerability.
Thus, ancient civilizations reframed harm and care from instinctive, interpersonal responses into ethical and civic duties.

Epoch III — Medieval to Early-Modern Institutions: Care as Social Infrastructure
As societies grew, the management of harm and the delivery of care became institutional. Medieval monasteries established infirmaries; Islamic hospitals pioneered medical ethics and training; early European cities experimented with social assistance.
Historical analyses of care conceptualizations show that the idea of “care” transformed significantly during this era — transitioning from individual charity to structured moral obligation (Reich). Care became tied to religious virtue, often gendered and bound to social expectations.
At the same time, new forms of harm emerged:
• Plagues and pandemics
• Urban crowding
• Famine
• Warfare at scale
These pushed societies toward systematic responses: quarantine laws, plague doctors, guild regulations, and eventually, the earliest public hospitals.
Psychological harm also entered discourse. Philosophers debated moral injury, spiritual distress, and social suffering — precursors to modern trauma theory.
This era marks a shift: care becomes institutional, and harm becomes a matter of public policy rather than private misfortune.

Epoch IV — The Public Health Revolution: Care at Population Scale
The Industrial Revolution reorganized human life — and generated unprecedented harm. Crowded cities, pollution, unsafe labor conditions, and rapid urbanization led to widespread illness and social breakdown.
In response, care became infrastructural.
Public health emerged as a discipline dedicated to preventing harm before it occurs. Tulchinsky notes how sanitation systems, vaccination programs, epidemiology, and food safety regulations transformed care into a large-scale societal function.
This era also birthed the professionalization of nursing, social work, and medicine. Harm became measurable; care became systemic. Governments assumed responsibility for protecting citizens from preventable risks.
Psychological and emotional harm, however, lagged behind — often misunderstood or stigmatized. It would take the late 20th and early 21st centuries for trauma to be recognized as a legitimate form of harm requiring structured care.
But the seeds were planted:
If harm could be reduced through design, policy, and engineering, then care could be embedded in the built world.

Epoch V — Modernity to the Present: Trauma, Design, and the Architecture of Care
In the late 20th and early 21st century, three revolutions converged:

1. Trauma-Informed Care (TIC)
Research in neuroscience and psychiatry clarified how trauma alters brain development, emotional regulation, and social behavior. Trauma-informed care frameworks — originating in the early 2000s — recast harm as physiological and relational, not merely moral failure or personal weakness (“Trauma-Informed Care”).

2. Human-Centered and Inclusive Design
Design thinking evolved from ergonomics to user-centered principles, culminating in human-centered design (HCD). By mid-century, scholars such as Auernhammer et al. documented the evolution of designing with, not merely for, people. These approaches emphasized empathy, user participation, and contextual awareness.

3. Ethical Expansions: The Moral Circle
Philosophical and sociological movements broadened the boundaries of who deserves care — including marginalized groups, animals, and ecosystems (“Moral Circle Expansion”). These expansions reflect cultural reckoning with historical harms and ethical obligations.
These converging movements set the stage for frameworks like CCD, which recognize:
Design is not neutral.
Harm can be engineered accidentally.
Care must be embedded intentionally.
Modern digital trauma, algorithmic bias, environmental collapse, and inequitable systems illustrate how harm now emerges not from scarcity but from complexity and scale — making coherent, care-informed design essential.

Conclusion: Toward a History-Aware Care-Centered Design

Across five epochs, a clear pattern emerges:
Harm widens with complexity; care evolves to meet it.
What begins as biological caregiving becomes moral philosophy, then institutional infrastructure, then policy, then design practice.
Today, CCD inherits thousands of years of human attempts to understand and reduce harm. It is not a break from history — it is its continuation.
From prehistoric compassion to modern design ethics, the arc bends toward attunement, protection, and flourishing.
