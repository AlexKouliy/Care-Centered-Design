Hexed and Healing: A Trauma-Informed Rebuttal to Visual Accessibility Standards

This paper explores how emotional safety, trauma-informed design principles, and
neurodivergent accessibility needs challenge conventional visual accessibility standards such as
WCAG 2.1. Using the author's firsthand experience of being asked to change a soft, sensory-safe
color palette into a harsher, contrast-driven alternative, this argument proposes that true
accessibility must include emotional regulation, sensory consent, and nervous-system-safe
design. Design must not only be readable—it must also be survivable.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) define visual accessibility primarily
through contrast ratios—with 4.5:1 considered the minimum threshold for body text. This
standard, while essential for visual clarity, ignores the emotional and sensory impact of highcontrast
design on trauma survivors, autistic individuals, and neurodivergent users.

When I, a neurodivergent designer with PTSD and sensory sensitivities, was told to replace my
original palette—a set of muted, harmonious greens and blues—with a higher-contrast system, I
experienced acute emotional dysregulation.

Every time I changed a shade, it felt like I was redressing a wound I didn’t cause. This reaction was not incidental. It exposed a critical gap in the accessibility model: readability without regard for emotional safety is not accessibility.
Color impacts the nervous system. Cool hues like muted greens and soft teals have been shown to reduce cortisol and promote relaxation, especially in environments involving trauma recovery (Annenberg Institute 2). For neurodivergent users, these tones help prevent sensory overload (Pheels). My original palette, which I named Healing, was structured as a six-part harmony: Evergreen (#29665E): grounding Healing (#009074): identity core Verdant (#58B947): vibrancy Meadow (#9DD088): emotional bridge Dew (#DCEDD4): breath
Together, these created what I call the Circle of Healing: a visually musical system modeled after the Circle of Fifths. Each color transitions smoothly, regulating visual input and avoiding spikes in stimulation.
WCAG’s contrast requirements are based on legibility for users with low vision, which is critical. But when applied rigidly, they can lead to visual environments that mimic clinical interfaces, military dashboards, or other trauma-associated aesthetics. In my case, the high-
contrast palette I was suggested to implement triggered emotional memories tied to hospitalization, coercion, and sensory trauma.

This isn’t rebellion. This is trauma-informed refusal. Studies have demonstrated the physiological effects of color on emotional state. Blue-green hues lower heart rate and support emotional regulation (Pineda et al. 3). Trauma-informed architecture guidelines recommend muted palettes for PTSD recovery spaces (JLG Architects). Even WCAG's own cognitive accessibility subgroup, COGA, has suggested that emotional safety be considered alongside legibility (Cognitive Accessibility).
The Healing palette was not a stylistic preference. It was a functional interface of care. We do not reject WCAG. We expand it.
True accessibility must include: Sensory-safe palettes Emotional readability Design that co-regulates, not just communicates We propose that future accessibility guidelines include a new category: Nervous System Safe Mode. Healing Mode is not an aesthetic indulgence—it is a trauma-informed right.

Not every user needs Healing Mode—but every user deserves the choice.
